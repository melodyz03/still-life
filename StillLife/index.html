          <p>I'm that first-person they talk about in all the books
        I'm that perspective you cannot doubt, see how I look
        Control the narrative reliably, baby, it's all about me
        And I wrote the book about throwing the book
        At those who don't do it by it
        So now I'm holding myself hostage
        Stockholm lust just looks like justice
        And enough lefts don't make the right but two wrongs do
        Oh man, Sun Tzu would love this
        Beating my dead high horse off the high road to low ground
        'Cause if you shake your fist at snakes in grass
        It looks like punching down
        So, God forbid I'm seen just as an average human being
        I mean, imagine if protagonists just died in the first scene
        I'm the gap between a tragedy and comedy
        Don't come at me
        I'm the main character, and you have to like me
        I loot plot armor from NPCs
        Well, they are to me
        Trite, tropes, traits, traumas, trinkets, and treats, it's all XP
        Look in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane, no, it's superego
        The underdog you cheer for
        Villains are everywhere, that's how I know that I'm the hero
        So tie me to the train tracks, laugh, and snidely twist your mustache
        Snidely Whiplash, Boris Badenov, ignoring me's bad enough
        Where do you get off? Da, das vedanya, darling
        Daleks in high collars monologue
        And I outsmart them with a ray-gun and a tweet
        So, God forbid I'm seen just as an average human being
        I mean, imagine if protagonists just died in the first scene
        I'm the gap between a tragedy and comedy
        Don't come at me
        I'm the main character, and you have to like me
        Judge me by what my cover shows, author becomes beyond reproach
        You don't know the prose or if the spine is still intact
        Oh, like Alice fell to Wonderland, come astroturf my Overton
        And embolden my demand to live by alternative facts
        Her majesty says, "The Royal We demand a standard of loyalty
        An agreement to be reverent, lick the emperor's new boots"
        The court fool got the guillotine
        The witches the stake, you the dopamine
        And Siemens made the Zyklon B, but we all still get the flu
        We all do what we need to to get through
        (It's nothing new)
        But I ain't done a fucking thing to you
        So, God forbid I'm seen just as an average human being
        I mean, imagine if antagonists lacked any evil scheme
        I'm the gap between a tragedy and comedy
        Don't come at me
            I'm the main character, and you have to like me
